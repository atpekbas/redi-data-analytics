# Exercises

The exercises are all in a flat hierarchy and follow the naming scheme `<lecture_no>-Exercise.ipynb`.

The `/data` folder contains all data sets necessary for the exercises. If further exercises are intended, their data sets are also to be placed in that folder.

This is done to ensure that the learners can jointly use the same path when loading datasets.
