## How to start Jupyter Lab
During class, we installed python, pip, pandas and jupyter lab. You then created a folder where you will work in during this course. You downloaded the .ipynb file from the exercise and put it into that folder. (e.g. C:/data_analytics)

1. Open up the terminal/cmd on your pc. (This is the “black box” application)

2. To go into into your folder, type:
    > cd C:/data_analytics
3. In there, you can start jupyter lab with:
    > python -m jupyterlab

This will open up your browser (Edge/Google Chrome), which is your working environment. You should see your files on the left side.

## How can I type "that" character?
If you have issues with your windows system language, or your keyboard layout, watch the video "How To Change Keyboard Language on Windows 11" (it is basically the same on all Windows systems).

This will give you two benefits:
1. You can choose the keyboard language that you are familiar with.
2. With the On-Screen keyboard, you can see where the characters are your keyboard. Hold SHIFT. You will see how some characters will be highlighted. Hold CTRL + ALT. You will see even more characters.
If the system Display language is also problematic for you (e.g. Danish), you can try to check the checkbox "Set as my Windows display language" (in the video at 2:14, which he tells you to uncheck). This will change the language of Windows itself (if your pc license allows it).
