## Python Installation Guide

Before the first lecture, we would like you to set up your laptops by following this guide. This will install the tools that we will use in class and you will use in your homework and project. We will introduce you to what they are in class. If you have problems, try googling it, ask your team, or your colleagues; use your learning groups!

__Info__: Whenever you see a command in this guide, it is meant to put into a terminal window. The Terminal is an application in Windows, MacOS and Linux that runs code. In Windows, the app is called "Command Prompt". On MacOS and Linux it is "Terminal".

1. Download and install the latest Python version: https://www.python.org/downloads/
__Important__: Make sure to check all boxes, especially the __"Add Python to environment variables"__ checkbox. To check, if python was installed correctly, open up the Terminal/Command Prompt application on your laptop and type the following command. It should show you the installed python version.
    > python --version
2. Install pip by running the command:
    > python -m ensurepip --upgrade
3. Install Jupyter lab:
    > pip install jupyterlab
4. Install pandas and numpy:
    > pip install pandas numpy



## How to start Jupyter Lab
During class, we installed python, pip, pandas and jupyter lab. You then created a folder where you will work in during this course. You downloaded the .ipynb file from the exercise and put it into that folder. (e.g. C:/data_analytics)

1. Open up the terminal/cmd on your pc. (This is the “black box” application)

2. To go into into your folder, type:
    > cd C:/data_analytics
3. In there, you can start jupyter lab with:
    > python -m jupyterlab

This will open up your browser (Edge/Google Chrome), which is your working environment. You should see your files on the left side.

## How can I type "that" character?
If you have issues with your windows system language, or your keyboard layout, watch the video "How To Change Keyboard Language on Windows 11" (it is basically the same on all Windows systems).

This will give you two benefits:
1. You can choose the keyboard language that you are familiar with.
2. With the On-Screen keyboard, you can see where the characters are your keyboard. Hold SHIFT. You will see how some characters will be highlighted. Hold CTRL + ALT. You will see even more characters.
If the system Display language is also problematic for you (e.g. Danish), you can try to check the checkbox "Set as my Windows display language" (in the video at 2:14, which he tells you to uncheck). This will change the language of Windows itself (if your pc license allows it).
